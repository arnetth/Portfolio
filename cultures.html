    <div id="Overview" class="tabcontent">
        <p><strong>As an email developer intern at LendingTree, I worked directly with the creative, marketing, and technical teams to produce fully-functioning, customer-facing emails that covered all the brands, products, and resources that the company has to offer.</strong></p>
        <p>I want to note that all the emails I developed except the Evergreen project were designed by LendingTree’s creative team. My day-to-day responsibilities involved working on Jira tickets, which included Zeplin files of email designs, subject lines and preheaders, and any other necessary information that I needed to know to develop the email. These emails had to not only look good, they had to work good. As a developer, I carefully completed a checklist of requirements for each email. They had to be developed for desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes for multiple browsers, and also had to be compatible with dark mode settings. Additionally, they had to be fully dynamic and personalized, in which the email’s content would change according to the user it is being sent out to, including the name, email heading, products, and even tables and images. Some emails also required external fetch and auto-login functions to log users directly into the MyLT app. I mostly used HTML, CSS, and Shopify Liquid to develop the emails.</p>

        <h2>Student Loan Hero Giveaway Emails</h2>
        <h4>Dipping into email marketing</h4>

        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
        <p>Early on in my internship, LendingTree’s child company that the team develops emails for, Student Loan Hero, was holding a scholarship giveaway for any high school or college students who signed up using their email. The purpose of this giveaway was to increase the number of Student Loan Hero email subscribers. One of my coworkers on the email marketing side of the team ran the email campaign for this giveaway, and she reached out to me for help.</p>
        <p><strong>Task</strong></p>
        <p>She felt that the email subject lines and preheaders that they were using for promoting this giveaway were not were not attractive enough to grab the attention of subscribers, so she asked me to think of some creative subject lines and preheaders that we could use to freshen up this campaign.</p>
        </div>
        <p><strong>Action</strong></p>
        <p>Starting off, I knew that I would need to understand what the campaign is doing already, and identify where it could improve. I looked at Student Loan Hero’s subject lines and preheaders to understand the company’s marketing appeal. I also looked at what its competitors are doing. I used companies like Niche and Fastweb to conduct some competitive research and analysis and used their emails as inspiration for my own ideas.</p>
        <p>While brainstorming, I reflected on my own experiences receiving scholarship emails. As a tuition-paying college student, I am well versed with emails sent from companies like Student Loan Hero. Personalized subject lines tend to attract my attention more, especially if it mentions my school. Some of Student Loan Hero’s competitors did this. The giveaway campaign’s old subject lines and preheaders were not personalized, or sometimes just with the users’ first names. From this, my main objective was to create some unique, personalized subject lines and preheaders. I knew that we could use <strong>Shopify Liquid</strong> to accomplish this.</p>
        <p>Here are a few subject lines and preheaders that I came up with:</p>
        <div id="subject-pre">
          <p>subject line</p>
          <p>preheader</p>
          <p>subject line</p>
          <p>preheader</p>
        </div>
        <p>After receiving feedback from my coworker and a few others leading this giveaway campaign, we made a few edits together. The next step for me was to test the subject lines and preheaders using Blueshift and Litmus to confirm that the users' personal data were displaying properly when emails were sent. My subject lines and preheaders were then added to the mix of emails sent out to users.</p>
        <p><strong>Results</strong></p>
        <p>I proved to my team that I am eager to learn, and I was willing to contribute more than just my scope of work. This was also my first experience collaborating with other professionals on a project, so this experience allowed me to further develop my collaboration, communication, critical thinking, marketing, and competitor research and analysis skills.</p>

          <p><strong>Project Duration</strong></p>
          <p>5-6 weeks</p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
        <p>The email team wanted to create a new set of emails to be used in customer communications journeys, which would direct them to LendingTree's free online articles and resources that are relevant to the customer's financial goals. For example, if a customer uses LendingTree to apply for a loan but they are rejected, we would want to send them an email for a LendingTree article about improving their credit score. We called these "evergreen" emails. The goal of this project was to increase customer engagement and improve our customer relationship management.</p>

        <p><strong>Task</strong></p>
        <p>I spearheaded this project from start to finish. I was given a list of specific articles and resources from the marketing team to design, develop, and write copy for.</p>

        <p><strong>Action</strong></p>
        <p>I designed, developed, and wrote the copy for all 35 "evergreen" emails.</p>
        <img id="eg-template" src="img/evergreen-template.png" alt="Evergreen email template in regular desktop style">
        <p>The first step in creating these emails was to design one email template for all 35 "evergreen" emails to maintain consistency. We wanted the design to be minimalistic and simple, drawing all of the attention to the article or resource information. The hero copy and subject lines are the titles of the articles or resources. To allow a visual break from text, I wanted to include a fitting icon for each email in the hero section. The email copy highlights the main points of the article and always includes a call-to-action button at the bottom which links to the article or resource itself.</p>

        <p><strong>Results</strong></p>
        <p>This project was significant in my internship experience because I was given a lot of wiggle room to make my own design and development decisions. I was able to personally test my skills to identify my strengths and weaknesses.</p>

      <h2>My Contributions</h2>
      <h4>Becoming a valued member of the team</h4>
      <hr>
      <p>Working as only 1 of 3 email developers at LendingTree posed a lot of new learning experiences at the start.</p>

      <p>When I first joined LendingTree as a summer intern, the email team only had two full-time email developers producing all customer-facing emails. As the email developer intern, I quickly learned how to develop emails using new tools like Litmus, Blueshift, and Zeplin, and within a few short weeks, I started producing high-quality emails to keep up with the large influx of Jira tickets. My team placed me on the path for success throughout the entire process, and in return I put forth my best effort. I was able to break the walls of being "the intern" to do more, learn more, and accomplish more for LendingTree as a valued employee.</p>

      <h4>Going beyond email development</h4>
      <hr>
      <p>I had several instances of troubleshooting complex problems for both the marketing side and the development side using my programming background.</p>
      <p>Emails are much more complex than I realized. My day-to-day responsibilities required a lot of troubleshooting technical problems. With heavily dynamic emails, dark mode styling, tons of customer data, accessibility protocols, and auto-login functions, it was inevitable that I ran into several problems that stumped me. Fortunately, I persevered through many issues thanks to my experiences coding in Java, C++, C#, and JavaScript, where similar programming logic applies.</p>
      <p>Not only did my programming background help directly troubleshoot problems in my emails, it also allowed me to cross-communicate between the technical teams and non-technical teams efficiently. I generally understood the technical team enough to communicate to the creative side in a manner that was understandable for them, and I personally learned a lot about cross-team collaboration as a result.</p>
