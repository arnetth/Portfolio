      <p><strong>Project Goal</strong></p>

      <p>To create my own website portfolio for the purposes of securing employment and documenting my achievements</p>

      <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

      <p>With the start of my last year at Purdue University, I needed to have more substantial development experiences under my belt to show off. Designing and developing my own website was an optimal way to showcase my best skills.</p>

      <p>This project was an essential learning experience for me. I created my own website- from scratch- completely by myself for the first time. From start to finish, I had many first experiences like using Figma and buying my own domain name. The newness of everything in this project resulted in numerous challenges that I had to overcome. No matter how big or small the problem was, I researched and carefully considered my options. All of the research, advice from professors, and trial-and-errors allowed me to learn so much more about my field and become significantly more confident in my abilities as a professional about to enter the workforce.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, this project was not all success like I was hoping. In the beginning, I set personal goals for myself to determine my own success upon completion. Here are the goals I set for this website:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Learn how to use Figma to design my website</li>
        <li>Use Figma and Zeplin to help me develop my website</li>
        <li>Learn how to use a framework to develop my website</li>
        <li>Do not use templates</li>
        <li>Add JavaScript functions that enhance the user experience</li>
        <li>Implement high-quality visuals throughout website</li>
        <li>Seek feedback and advice from trusted professionals</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I managed to accomplish all of my goals except the second and third bullets on the list.</p>

      <p>For the second bullet, I didn’t fully design each page of my website on Figma, and I didn’t use Zeplin either. Instead I used Figma more as design suggestions to visualize my ideas on screen before implementing them into the website itself. I was adding and making revisions directly to my website as I was developing it, so I abandoned the idea of relying on Figma and Zeplin early on. I liked the idea of experimenting with the code itself more than seeing the updates visually on Figma.</p>

      <img src="img/figma.PNG" alt="screenshot of my Figma files" id="figma" />

      <p>For the third bullet, I tried to learn React and implement it into my website, but I realized almost instantly that learning a framework for the first time was not a quick task. I needed this website to be done as soon as possible to begin applying for full-time positions so I had to skip it. I’ve never used a framework before but I know how relevant they are in my field, so I was disappointed that I didn’t have time to learn. On the bright side, I am on the lookout for any opportunities in the future where I can appropriately learn and implement a framework in a project.</p>

      <p>Creating my own website was something I had always wanted to do. In the past, I've tried and failed several times, but this time I can proudly say I succeeded. My website is just the first of many digital products I will create in my career, which I look forward to in the years to come!</p>
